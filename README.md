# Inventor Music Store App

This is a fullstack python program that stores music information in an inventory-styled interface. It stores the title of song, name of artiste, music genre, year of song release, and copyright number of songs the user enters. The program saves this data in a python SQLite database.

# Users Can:

1. SHOW list of all songs stored in the database
2. SEARCH songs in the store
3. ADD their favorite songs to the store
4. UPDATE selected song
5. DELETE selected song
6. CLOSE the store

# Basic Scripts

The program has a .exec file in the build dist folder that users can easily access and test the app by performing some of its functionalities aforementioned.

There's a frontend.py file that you can run inside an IDE to test the app.

# NOTE

This is a refactored/updated version from one of my python projects. It reflects some of my knowledge in python and creating a full stack python app.
